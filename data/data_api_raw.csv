For its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped birth the inventive culinary movement known as ""molecular gastronomy."" Though other books have been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. Among the major themes addressed throughout the new edition are: · Traditional and modern methods of food production and their influences on food quality · The great diversity of methods by which people in different places and times have prepared the same ingredients · Tips for selecting the best ingredients and preparing them successfully · The particular substances that give foods their flavors, and that give us pleasure · Our evolving knowledge of the health benefits and risks of foods On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781416556374'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1416556370'}]",True,False,898,BOOK,['Cooking'],4.0,26,NOT_MATURE,True,0.21.15.0.preview.2,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bKVCtH4AjwgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bKVCtH4AjwgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.fr/books?id=bKVCtH4AjwgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=food&hl=&as_brr=6&cd=4&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.fr/books?id=bKVCtH4AjwgC&dq=food&hl=&as_brr=6&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Food_and_Cooking.html?hl=&id=bKVCtH4AjwgC,FR,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,FR,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY,True,http://books.google.fr/books/download/On_Food_and_Cooking-sample-epub.acsm?id=bKVCtH4AjwgC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=bKVCtH4AjwgC&hl=&as_brr=6&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"For its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking.

Richard Hoskings eliminates the mystery by ensuring that each entry in the Japanese-English section includes the Japanese term in Roman script; the term in kana or kanji or both; a Latin name where appropriate; an English definition; and, for most entries, a short annotation. The English-Japanese section defines important English food terms in Japanese and annotates those needing explanation. One hundred small line drawings make it easy for readers to identify everything from mitsuba to the okoze fish, and seventeen appendices address the most critical elements of Japanese cuisine, from the making of miso and the structure of the Japanese meal to the tea ceremony.

The text, illustrations, and bibliographies have all been brought up-to-date. My goal has been to provide an accurate and reasona bly detailed description of every major snack processing method and prod uct current in the United States. If any reader believes I have omitted an important topic, I would be glad to learn ofit, in the hope that there will be a Third Edition in which I can incorporate the suggested additions. One of the main purposes of this volume is to provide a source for answers to problems that the technologist encounters in the course of his or her daily work. Extensive bibliographies, in which the emphasis is on recent publications (extending into 1983), should permit the reader to resolve more complex or new questions. With these bibliographies as guides, the food technologist can delve as deeply as he or she wishes into specialized aspects ofthe subject, while at the same time the reader who is interested in the broad overall picture will not be distracted by excess detail.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789401097789'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '940109778X'}]",False,True,422,BOOK,['Technology & Engineering'],5.0,1,NOT_MATURE,False,1.3.3.0.preview.1,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qdnuCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qdnuCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.fr/books?id=qdnuCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=food&hl=&as_brr=6&cd=27&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qdnuCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qdnuCAAAQBAJ,FR,FOR_SALE,True,FR,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qdnuCAAAQBAJ&hl=&as_brr=6&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,This book fills a need for a technological guide in a field that has experi enced an almost explosive increase in the last two decades.,126.59,EUR,88.61,EUR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qdnuCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-qdnuCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 126590000, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 88610000, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'giftable': True}]",http://books.google.fr/books/download/Snack_Food_Technology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=qdnuCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api

For everyone who wonders why, in this era of advanced medicine, we still suffer so much serious illness, Food and Healing is essential reading. “An eminently practical, authoritative, and supportive guide to making everyday decisions about eating that can transform our lives. Food and Healing is a remarkable achievement.”—Richard Grossman, Director, The Health in Medicine Project, Montefiore Medical Center Annemarie Colbin, founder of New York's renowned Natural Gourmet Cookery School and author of The Book of Whole Meals, argues passionately that we must take responsibility for our own health and rely less on modern medicine, which still seems to focus on trying to cure rather than prevent illness. Eating well, she shows, is the first step toward better health. Drawing on an impressive range of thinking—from Eastern philosophy to current medical journals—Colbin shatters many myths not only about the “Standard American Diet” but also about some of the quirky and unhealthy food fads of recent years. What emerges is one of the first complete works on: • How food affects our moods • The healing qualities of specific foods • The role of diet in preventing illness • How to tailor a diet approach that is right for you “I recommend it to my patients. . . .

The food industry is the largest sector of our economy; food touches everything from our health to the environment, climate change, economic inequality, and the federal budget. From the earliest developments of agriculture, a major goal has been to attain sufficient foods that provide the energy and the nutrients needed for a healthy, active life. Over time, food production, processing, marketing, and consumption have evolved and become highly complex. The challenges of improving the food system in the 21st century will require systemic approaches that take full account of social, economic, ecological, and evolutionary factors. Policy or business interventions involving a segment of the food system often have consequences beyond the original issue the intervention was meant to address. A Framework for Assessing Effects of the Food System develops an analytical framework for assessing effects associated with the ways in which food is grown, processed, distributed, marketed, retailed, and consumed in the United States. The framework will allow users to recognize effects across the full food system, consider all domains and dimensions of effects, account for systems dynamics and complexities, and choose appropriate methods for analysis. This report provides example applications of the framework based on complex questions that are currently under debate: consumption of a healthy and safe diet, food security, animal welfare, and preserving the environment and its resources. A Framework for Assessing Effects of the Food System describes the U.S. food system and provides a brief history of its evolution into the current system. This report identifies some of the real and potential implications of the current system in terms of its health, environmental, and socioeconomic effects along with a sense for the complexities of the system, potential metrics, and some of the data needs that are required to assess the effects. The overview of the food system and the framework described in this report will be an essential resource for decision makers, researchers, and others to examine the possible impacts of alternative policies or agricultural or food processing practices.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780309307833'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '030930783X'}]",True,False,340,BOOK,['Medical'],4.0,1,NOT_MATURE,False,0.4.5.0.preview.2,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SxM9CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SxM9CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.fr/books?id=SxM9CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=food&hl=&as_brr=6&cd=140&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SxM9CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SxM9CgAAQBAJ,FR,FOR_SALE,True,FR,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=SxM9CgAAQBAJ&hl=&as_brr=6&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"A Framework for Assessing Effects of the Food System develops an analytical framework for assessing effects associated with the ways in which food is grown, processed, distributed, marketed, retailed, and consumed in the United States.",58.18,EUR,58.18,EUR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SxM9CgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-SxM9CgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 58180000, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 58180000, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'giftable': True}]",

Then she meets Tomasso, who's handsome, young -- and cooks in the exclusive Templi restaurant. Perfect. Except, unbeknownst to Laura, Tomasso is in fact only a waiter at Templi -- it's his shy friend Bruno who is the chef. But Tomasso is the one who knows how to get the girls, and when Laura comes to dinner he persuades Bruno to help him with the charade. It works: the meal is a sensual feast, Laura is utterly seduced and Tomasso falls in lust. But it is Bruno, the real chef who has secretly prepared every dish Laura has eaten, who falls deeply and unrequitedly in love.
